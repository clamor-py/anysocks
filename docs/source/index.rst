Welcome to anysocks' documentation!
===================================

``anysocks`` is an easy and simple WebSocket client library built on top of
`anyio <https://github.com/agronholm/anyio>`_. Hence, you can freely
choose between ``asyncio``, ``trio``, and ``curio`` backends and therefore
it is pretty easy to integrate into existing async applications.
